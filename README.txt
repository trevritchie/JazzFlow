JazzFlow leverages the intergenerational knowledge of composers to transform old compositions into new harmonies.
Starting with a single input piece, JazzFlow outputs 32 unique variations. For the modern composer, this saves time
for experimentation. Also, the rich, oftenunexpected harmonies produced may provide inspiration.

This program takes MIDI files, diatonically transposes the pieces through Barry Harris' scales of chords, 
and writes new MIDI files.
